<h2>API classes:</h2>
The classes for manipulating TCP sockets are declared in “include/TCPsocket.hpp”, “include/TCPserver.hpp” 
and “include/TCPclient.hpp”. These header files are commented, and will permit you to understand the API classes.
And of course, there defined in “src/TCP*.cpp”.

UDP classes will be developed soon, like TCP classes, everything will be explained in there header files(include/UDP*.hpp).

After understanding the API classes, codes located in the “examples/” directory will be a good place to get started.
