# Kadiya

<u><h2>OVERVIEW:</h2></u>
<p>Kadiya gives a developer the comfort to write socket programs with the use of objects on Windows and Linux Systems.</p>

<p>Since I'm still working on initializing the project, Make and Cmake haven't been set up for command line compilation.</p>
<p>For now, Visual Studio could be used to compiled the project.</p>
<p>Linux throws a runtime-error.</p>
